## Introduction

This project aims to detect and predict floods using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. Flooding is a significant natural disaster that can cause severe damage to lives and property. Leveraging machine learning techniques for flood detection can help provide early warnings and take appropriate actions to mitigate the impact of flooding.

## Project Overview

In this project, we implement a flood detection system using deep learning models and TensorFlow. The system uses various data sources, such as satellite images, weather data, and other relevant information, to predict and monitor potential flood events. The goal is to create an accurate and reliable system for real-time flood detection.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Reshape the image and take it to array.

- **Deep Learning Models:** In this project, i using ConvNeXtXLarge model fro keras and fine-tune it for the best performance.

- **Result:** Create a csv file to store the result from model.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- PIL (for image processing)
- Additional libraries as specified in the project's requirements file

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flood-detection-using-tensorflow.git
   ```

2. Run it on the kaggle plattform:
   - Because of the problem about the device, i decide to run it on plattform for ML/DL.

## Usage

1. To use this flood detection system, follow the steps mentioned in the project documentation or Jupyter notebooks if provided.

2. Customize the model according to your specific use case and data sources.

3. Run the file on kaggle.
