## Introduction

This project aims to detect and predict floods using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. Flooding is a significant natural disaster that can cause severe damage to lives and property. Leveraging machine learning techniques for flood detection can help provide early warnings and take appropriate actions to mitigate the impact of flooding.

## Project Overview

In this project, we implement a flood detection system using deep learning models and TensorFlow. The system uses various data sources, such as satellite images, weather data, and other relevant information, to predict and monitor potential flood events. The goal is to create an accurate and reliable system for real-time flood detection.

## Features

- **Data Integration:** Utilizes various data sources, including satellite imagery and weather data, to enhance flood detection accuracy.

- **Deep Learning Models:** Implements state-of-the-art deep learning models for image analysis and prediction.

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Provides real-time monitoring and alerts for potential flood events.

- **Scalable:** The system is designed to be scalable, allowing for the incorporation of additional data sources and models.
